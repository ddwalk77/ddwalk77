## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Debra Walker, but I go by DeeDee.

### Iâ€™m currently wrapping up my M.S. in Data Analytics, completing coursework at the end of June 2023.

#### I love to read because I love a great story and all its relationships. The information gained about history, impacts from decisions, and the future to come, whether it be about people, places, or events, is knowledge. That is why I find myself enthusiastic at work when breaking down data, to see the stories inside, with all their patterns and connections. Itâ€™s exciting to utilize that information to make decisions and predictions. My educational and employment background demonstrates this through the chosen study areas and the improvements implemented in all workplaces. As I wrap up my masters in data analytics, Iâ€™m seeking an opportunity for continued growth, the next puzzle to crack, insights to gain, and improvements to make.

### Check out my repos to see some of my academic work. I'm looking forward to applying my new skills in the work force.
