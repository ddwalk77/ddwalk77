## Hi there 👋 My name is Debra Walker, but I go by DeeDee.

### I just completed my M.S. in Data Analytics, June 2023, and am excited to start down this journey

### Check out my repos to see some of my academic work. I'm looking forward to applying my new skills in the work force.

#### I love to read because I love a great story and all its relationships. The information gained about history, impacts from decisions, and the future to come, whether it be about people, places, or events, is knowledge. That is why I find myself enthusiastic at work when breaking down data, to see the stories inside, with all their patterns and connections. It’s exciting to utilize that information to make decisions and predictions. My educational and employment background demonstrates this through the chosen study areas and the improvements implemented in all workplaces. I’m excited about the continued growth, the next puzzle to crack, insights to gain, and improvements to make.
